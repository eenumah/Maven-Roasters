# Maven-Roasters
Being hired as the lead Business Intelligence Analyst for Maven Roasters, a small-batch coffee chain based in New York City.
All I’ve been given is a collection of raw csv files containing sales and inventory records, along with details about the company’s products, customers, stores and employees. The goal is to use Power BI and DAX to answer key questions about the Maven Roasters business, including sales trends, inventory, top products, and orders.
